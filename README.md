This is **fairify**, our team’s submission for StormHacks 2021.
## What's The Issue

In an increasingly complex world, unethical and unfair practices are becoming harder to identify, while honest businesses are struggling to stand out against all the insincere marketing of big corporations (also known as fairwashing). 

It feels like every day there’s another uncovered secret about a brand or product whose unethical practices have long gone under my radar.
## Big Question 1

So naturally, we found ourselves looking into fair-trade, an arrangement designed to help producers in growing countries achieve sustainable and equitable trade relationships. 

By connecting a diverse group of producers, companies, and consumers, the powerful fair trade movement is able to help everyone do what is right for families, fellow global citizens, and the planet.
## Big Question 2

And this led us to the question, how do we shop ethically and sustainably? 

The answer is by voting with our money for responsible companies and products that have fair trade certifications from major organisations, and a great community reputation. However, as there are many companies that actively take part in “fairwashing”, is there a way we could easily, conveniently and accurately determine whether a product is ethically produced?
## Our Solution

Presenting fairify, your go-to platform for everything fair-trade. By providing you with compiled fair-trade certifications, related news articles, and easily understandable metrics, you can support and share ethical and sustainable practices with ease.

Our fair trade composite rating is compiled using four metrics. Number one, a reputation score computed based on a company’s the online communities review. Number two, a fair trade news score gleaned articles scraped from reliable sources and analysed with our natural language processing toolkit. Number three, a sentiment index calculated based on a evidence of a companies efforts to support fair trade. And four, a lookup of a company’s fair trade certificates from related databases.
